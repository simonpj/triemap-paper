\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The designs of many programming languages include a feature where some concrete use of a construct is matched against a set of possible interpretations, where the possible interpretations might be defined in terms of variables to be instantiated at concrete usages. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Haskell's class instances work this way: the user defines instances (which may contain variables), and then concrete usage sites of class methods require finding an instance that applies.
\item Agda, Coq, and Idris all have implicit-argument features directly inspired by Haskell's class mechanism.
\item An extension to Haskell allows overloaded instances, where we select the most specific instance (that is, one that is a specialization of any other possible matching instance).
\item C++ and Java both support function overloading, where a usage site of a function must be matched against a choice of implementation. C++'s templates and Java's generics allow for variables to be used in the implementations. There are sometimes multiple implementations that match; both languages choose the most specific match (for an appropriate definition of "most specific").
\item C++ separately allows template specialization, where a templated definition can have concrete specializations. Once again, selection of these specializations depends on a "most-specific" relation appropriate to the case.
\item Scala? C\#?
\end{itemize}
Beyond features specified in a language's design, optimizations may require such a structure. For example, GHC's rewrite rules~\cite{rewrite-rules} requires a similar lookup to find a mapping from expressions to rules that may apply.

Our concern here is the efficient implementation of this matching
operation. That is, we wish to define a structure mapping keys to
arbitrary values. The keys are chosen from a type described by a
context-free grammar and thus comprise small trees. We assume a total
ordering on such trees. The challenge lies in the fact that we want
our structure to support wildcard variables, which represent any tree
at all. We will write such variables with Greek letters. Accordingly,
we can view a mapping \lstinline{alpha |-> v} as an infinite mapping, connecting
all possible trees to v, or we can have \lstinline{Maybe alpha |-> v2} map all
trees whose root is Maybe to the value v2. Combining these to `alpha
|-> v, Maybe alpha |-> v2` would map all trees to v, except those
trees that have Maybe at the root, which map to v2. Accordingly,
looking up in our structure find the most specific
match.\footnote{This aspect of our design is unforced. We could also
return all possible matches, instead of selecting the most
specific. See \cref{sec:most-specific}.}

Our contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item We describe the language-agnostic Variable Trie-Map (VTM) data structure, with the semantics as described above (and made more precise in \cref{sec:vtm}). The keys in a VTM support local bound variables via on-the-fly conversion to de Bruijn levels, necessary to support polymorphic types or $\lambda$-expressions. Looking up in a VTM is linear in the size of the key, regardless of the size of the VTM itself. The operations on a VTM are proved to uphold the sensible properties described in \cref{sec:vtm-properties}.
\item Some languages require not only the matching behavior above, but also a \emph{unification} operation, where we find not only keys that match, but keys that would match if variables in the looked-up tree were further instantiated. \Cref{sec:unification} describes how we extend VTMs to support unification as well as matching.
\item While VTMs are time-efficient, they can be space-inefficient. \Cref{sec:path-compression} describes an easy optimization which drastically reduces the memory footprint of VTMs whose keys share little structure in common. This optimization shows a 30% geometric mean savings in the size of the structure GHC uses to look up rewrite rules.
\item Our work was motivated by quadratic behavior in GHC, observed when checking for instance consistency among imports. This became a problem in practice in Haskell's use at Facebook. We report on our implementation within GHC, showing that it achieves a 98% speedup against the previous (admittedly naive) implementation of instance tables.
\end{itemize}

\section{Job description}

Our general task is as follows: \emph{implement a finite mapping from keys to values,
in which the key type is some kind of tree}.
For example, a \lstinline|ExprMap a| might map a \lstinline{Expr} to a value of type \lstinline{a}, providing operations
such as\footnote{The function \lstinline{alterTM} is a standard generalisation of \lstinline{insert},
  in which the element to be inserted is generalised to a function \lstinline{XT a}, an abbreviation for
  \lstinline{Maybe a -> Maybe a}.
  This function transforms the existing value associated with key, if any (hence the \lstinline{Maybe}), to
  a new value, with \lstinline{Nothing} indicating deletion.}
\begin{code}
  type XT a = Maybe a -> Maybe a
  emptyEM  :: ExprMap a
  lookupEM :: Expr -> ExprMap a -> Maybe a
  insertEM :: Expr -> a -> ExprMap a -> ExprMap a
  alterEM  :: Expr -> XT a -> ExprMap a -> ExprMap a
\end{code}
Here a \lstinline{Expr} might be defined like this:
\begin{code}
  data Expr = Lit Lit
            | App Expr Expr
            | Lam  Var Expr
            | Var Var
\end{code}
Here \lstinline{Var} is the type of variables; which can be compared for
equality and used as the key of a finite map.  Literals, of type \lstinline{Lit},
include functions such as \lstinline{add}, and constants such as \lstinline{23}.
Neithe type is important for this paper, but for the sake of concretemess
you could imagine them both being simply a string:
\begin{code}
  type Var = String
  type Lit = String
\end{code}
The data type \lstinline{Expr} is capable of representing expressions like $add 2 3$
$\lambda x. add x 3$.  We will use this data type throughout the paper, because it
has all the features that occur in real expression data types: literals, variables,
binders, and nodes with multiple children.  A real-world compiler like GHC would have
many more constructors in the data type.

A finite map keyed by such expressions is extremely useful.
GHC uses \lstinline{ExprMap} during its common sub-expression
elimination pass, where the \lstinline{ExprMap} associates an
expression with the identifier bound to that exrpession; if the same
expression occurs again, we can look it up in the map, and replace the
exrpession with the variable.

GHC also does many lookups based on \emph{types} rather than \emph{expressions},
when implementing type-class instance lookup, or doing type-family reduction.
A map whose key is a \emph{Type} woudl be perfect for this task.

\subsection{Alpha-renaming}

Remember that the type \lstinline{Expr} is the \emph{key} of our \lstinline{ExprMap} type.
So we would expect insertion and lookup to be insensitive to
$\alpha$-renaming. For example suppose we insert a value with key
$(\lambda x. add x 3)$, and then look up the
key $(\lambda y. add y 3)$: we should
certainly expect to find the value we inserted, even though the name
of the $\lambda$-bound variable has changed.

We will use the \

In GHC we want more: we want to a lookup that does \emph{matching}.
\simon{Say more}.

\section{Non-solutions} \label{sec:ord}

At first sight the job can be done easily: define a total order on
\lstinline{Expr}, make it an instance of the class \lstinline{Ord},
and use a standard finite map library such as \lstinline{Data.Map}.
And indeed that works, but it is terribly slow.  A finite map is
implemented as a binary search tree; at every node of this tree, we compare the key (a \lstinline{Expr}, remember) with
a key stored at the node; if it is smaller, go left; if larger, go right. So each lookup
a (logarithmic) number of potentially-full-depth comparisons of two types.

Another possibility might be to hash the \lstinline{Expr} and use the
hash-code as the lookup key.  That would make lookup much faster, but
it requires at least two full traversals of the key for every lookup:
one to compute its hash code for every lookup, and a full equality
comparison on a ``hit'' because hash-codes can collide.  Moreover
hashing algorithms that respect $\alpha$-conversion are not trivial
\cite{alpha-hashing}.

\section{Tries}

A rather standard approach to a finite map in which the key has internal structure
is to use a \emph{trie} \cite{trie}.  Let us consider a simplified
form of expression:
\begin{code}
  data ExprS = LitS Lit | AppS ExprS ExprS
\end{code}
We have dropped variables and lambdas for now, to concentrate on the initial idea.
Here is a trie-based implemenation for \lstinline{ExprS}:
\begin{code}
  data ExprSMap a = ESM { esm_lit :: Map Lit a
                        , esm_app :: ExprSMap (ExprSMap a) }
\end{code}
Here `Map Lit a` is any standard, existing finite map keyed by `Lit`.
There are many such finite maps available for an ordered type like `Lit`;
the `containers` package will do as well as any.

One way to understand this slightly odd data type is to study its lookup function:
\begin{code}
lkExprS :: ExprS -> ExprSMap a -> Maybe a
lkExprS (LitS lit)   m = Map.lookup lit (esm_lit m)
lkExprS (AppS e1 e2) m = case lkExprS e1 (esm_app m) of
                           Nothing -> Nothing
                           Just m1 -> lkExprS e2 m1
\end{code}
The expression \lstinline{esm_lit m} selects the \lstinline{esm_lit} field from the record \lstinline{m}.  So the first
equation says that to look up a literal, just look that literal up in the \lstinline{esm_lit} field.
But if the expression is an \lstinline{(AppS e1 e2)} node, we first look up \lstinline{e1}
in the \lstinline{esm_app} field, \emph{which returns a finite map}.  We then look up \lstinline{e2}
in that map.  Each distinct \lstinline{e1} yields a different map in which to look up \lstinline{e2}.

Notice that in contrast to the approach of \Cref{sec:ord}, we never compare two expressions
for equality or ordering.  We simply walk down the \lstinline{ExprMap} structure, guided
at each step by the next node in the target.  (We typically use the term ``target'' for the
key we are looking up in the finite map.)

Here is the code for altering a binding in the map:
\begin{code}
  xtExprS  :: Expr -> XT a -> ExprMap a -> ExprMap a
\end{code}

\end{document}
